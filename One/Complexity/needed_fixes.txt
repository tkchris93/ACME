Section Timing Functions - fix the timeit box
Fix Problem 1
- change the size of the matrices
- have the students do it twice and take the average.
- have them name the labels what the function does, instead of Function 1, 2, 3, etc.

There are lots of places that need Joey's fix.

Problem 2
- see if Joey's fix will work to make the word "format" not blue.

Problem 3
- it is impossible to check if this is implemented correctly the vector b is random. To check if it's correct, we need to have the students return A, x and b, then run:
         np.allclose(A.dot(x), b.flatten())
