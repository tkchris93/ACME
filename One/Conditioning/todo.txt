Changes that need to be done:
- change e^-10 to 1e-10 in Problem 1
- change all the titles to proper capitalization
- I think the line that says w_roots = np.sort(w_roots) is useless
- Problem 1, you should change all the coefficients, not just one.
- make it clear what the x and y axes are in the graph on Problem 1
- change variance to standard deviation to match np.random.normal()
- 10^20 needs to be fixed.
- the catastrophic cancellation equation needs to omit the last term.
