Changes that need to be done:
x change e^-10 to 1e-10 in Problem 1
x I think the line that says w_roots = np.sort(w_roots) is useless
x Problem 1, you should change all the coefficients, not just one.
x make it clear what the x and y axes are in the graph on Problem 1
x change variance to standard deviation to match np.random.normal()
x 10^20 needs to be fixed.
x the catastrophic cancellation equation needs to omit the last term.
