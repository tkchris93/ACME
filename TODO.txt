Getting Started
- Add generator xrange in place of range.  Change problem about odds to use generators instead.
- Write solutions file
- Write test driver

Installation Guide
- Write all of it.  Decide whether or not to include pictures. At the very least, get Appendix A done.

Fourier II
- Write outline. Keep most things the same. Circular convolution didn't make much sense. Make the tada example at the end a problem instead
- Mess around with different balloon pops.

Bacon
- time and provide feedback

Shell 
- Finish all the TODO's
- Get Shane, Ben, Jared, Alexander, and Chris to look at it.
- Write solutions file
- Write test driver/script.

Data Structurs II
- provide feedback.  I think it was pretty solid, though.
