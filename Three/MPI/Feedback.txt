It looks to me like passValue and Send_example demonstrate the same thing, but then again, it is nice to have two different examples.
recieved --> received in multiple places
numpy --> NumPy

-Problem 4
How are you supposed to pass n into our function? Isn't the number of processes passed to the mpirun function?
Might be worth mentioning in Problem 4 that this is UNIT m-sphere.
It's a little unclear that each process is supposed to take initial averages before passing it to the root process. 
I really like this lab. I think there isn't much beyond these minor tweaks that are needed.
