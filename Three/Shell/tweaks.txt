Figure out a better SSH problem.
sed, awk
md5, sha
tar, zip, unzip
su
top, htop, free
curl, wget
hostname, uname, w
alias
who

=============================
uname     & OS name
uname -a  & print all system information
uname -m  & print machine hardware
passwd    & change password

tar & creates an archive
tar -cz & creates and compresses an archive
zip & windows friendly
unzip & extract .zip files
tar -xz & extract .tar.gz files

ps -f        & full listing showing the PPID of each process
ps -e or -A  & All processes including user and system processes
ps -u usr    & Processes of user usr only
ps -a        & Processes of all user excluding processes associated with \
               terminal
ps -l        & Long listing showing memory-related information
ps -t term   & Processes running on terminal term (say, /dev/console)

top          & displays top processes (hit q to stop running top)
at           & run a job at a specific time

=============
add wc and more to table 1.5 Commands for print contents of a file
add tee to pipes and redirects. Sends stream both ways 
  ls /usr/sbin | tee processes.txt | less
make sure I included nohup
add !, -o, and -a to find
find out how much of regular expression has already been addressed
