Compression
-z means use gzip
-v means verbose (print what's happening)
-f means force (not sure what this is for. Just do it!)
tar -zcvf <archive> <files/directory> & create .tar.gz archive of files/directory
tar -ztvf <archive>                   & view contents of archive
tar -zxvf <archive>                   & extract contents of archive to current directory

zip <zipname> <files/directory>    & compress files/directory to zipname
unzip -l <zip file>                & list contents of zip file (useful to know whether you should \
                                     move the archive to a new folder before extracting or not
unzip <zip file>                   & extract zip archive

File management
mv                          & move and rename 
cp                          & copy file 
cp -r                       & copy directory with all its contents
mkdir                       & create new directory
rmdir                       & remove empty directory
rm [-i, -v]                 & remove file

Checksum Commands

GENERAL NOTES:
Bring in uname, whoami, w, passwd, hostname with the ssh stuff. Say, "you may want to find out more information on what is going on with the machine you have connected to. It may be necessary to see how the machine is being used to see if you will be able to allocate a sufficient number of resources. etc."

Figure out what top, htop, and free are used for and add it to the job control section. Maybe create a separate section from job control called Resource Management dealing with space and processes and all that jazz.

Commands to research fully:
- top
- htop
- free (is it just good for looking at remaining memory?)
- curl
- wget
- md5
- sha
- sed (get more grounded)
- awk (get more grounded)
