I think that we won't need to change a lot with this lab content-wise. I think that it's pretty good. If it was difficult for the students last year, I think it would be because they didn't understand the first Fourier lab.  With the changes we have made to that lab, I feel like this lab is now much more managable.
Circular convolution didn't make much sense, but it's clearly important.
The tada material at the end of the lab should be a problem.  Right now, it's just an example.
The biggest thing that needs to be addressed is the balloon problem. It took forever for me to get that one right, but it was so rewarding when I did.  The thing that tripped me up was including "axis=0" in the fft AND the ifft. We should add a warning box that says because these files are stereo, you must specify an axis or get it all wrong.  Ben and I both got tripped up on this one.
I had to ask somebody what it meant to do pointwise multiplication.

AND, the solutions file for this lab is TOTALLY wrong. I looked at it for a hint when I was having issues with the balloon problem and it's all kinds of messed up.
